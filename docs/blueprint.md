## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant green (#76B347), evoking freshness and association with food and finance. 
- Background color: A light green (#E2F0DA), desaturated and bright to complement the primary color without overwhelming the interface.
- Accent color: A soft orange (#D9883D), positioned approximately 30 degrees to the left on the color wheel, offering a warm contrast for calls to action and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern and neutral look, suitable for both headlines and body text. 
- Employ clear, intuitive icons to represent different functionalities such as item selection, payment status, and receipt uploading.
- Design a clean, user-friendly layout that is intuitive on mobile devices, focusing on ease of navigation and clarity in displaying bill information.
- Use subtle animations to provide feedback on user interactions, such as marking items as paid or updating totals.
